# tic tac oh...

A puzzle game made in C that runs on the terminal. 

**You must let the lvls.txt file in the same folder of the compiled tic_tac_oh program for it to run!**

The terminal you run the game on has to be ANSI compatible for it to work properly. 
If it prints weird characters and no colors, then it must not be ANSI compatible. 

tic tac oh... is a puzzle game that takes inspiration from tic tac toe, but it's not a competition between two players.  
It's a single player game where you place all the pieces, X's and O's, on the board, trying to achieve all the
conditions to complete each level. 
What are those conditions? It's up to you to find out. 

Thank you for playing - cauÃª
